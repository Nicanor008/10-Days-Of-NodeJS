## Why Use NodeJS
- Fast, efficient and highly scalable
- Event driven, non-blocking I/O model(asynchoronous)
- popular in the industry
- Same language on frontend and backend

## NodeJS application areas
- REST API & Microservices
- Real time services e.g. chat, live updates

### Module.exports

- importing this way `const person = require('./person')` is called **commonjs**(Module Formatting system, It is a standard for structuring and organizing JavaScript code.)
