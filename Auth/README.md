# Authentication module
> **Background** - Authentication has been my common implementation, hence generation of a re-usable code in every project

## Getting Started
- `git clone` & cd into `Auth`
- yarn or npm install
- `yarn dev`(dev) or`yarn start`(prod) to run server
- on browser `http://localhost/docs` to access documentations

## Plans
- Passport JS(OAuth)
- Tests(unit & integration)
- ES6
- TypeScript
